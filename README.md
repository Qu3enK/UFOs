# UFO Sightings
<sup>(Note: Use UFO Challenge folder)</sup>

## Overview
The purpose of the UFO Sightings site is to provide a website with a list of potential UFO sightings in which users can view and filter the information based on specific criteria.  We utilized Javascript, HTML and CSS to establish arrays based on existing data and ForEach method to loop through the data for filtering.   [^1]

## Results
In partnering with Dana, we were able to develop a website that may be filtered by one and up to 5 criteria.  Utilizing multiple ```input``` functions in the HTML script, we are able to filter by:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

The filtered results will display in a table within the website page.

## Summary
There are a couple of drawbacks with the site:
- The input is case sensitive, the criteria must be lower case
- The input must match exactly the criteria that is being searched
- There is a not a button to clear the search criteria

We recommend adjusting the script to allow for upper, lower and proper case.  Also, include a 'clear filter' button, to allow for additional ease of use of the website. These adjustment will assist the website being more user friendly.
